You can run the file by downloading it and open the terminal 
and run npm i

For the next requirement you need to open two seperate terminals one for backend and one for Frontend [but before that you have to set up your MONGODB atlas]

For Frontend -
cd frontend and then npm run dev

For Backend - 
npm run server in the chat directly



ALL THE BEST !!!!!
